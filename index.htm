						<h2>ArtBot</h2>
						<img src='IMG_8131.JPG', alt='Pic of Artbot'>
						<h3 class='caption'>ArtBot, Design II Senior Capstone Project - Spring 2021</h3>
						<p>ArtBot is a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) Robot that is able to draw/paint customized artwork from photographs using custom software.</p>
						<p>It utilizes stepper motors and a CNC motor controller plugged into an Arduino Uno.  The system is driven by toothed belts for the X and Y axes of motion, with a dual rack and pinion driving the z-axis implement control.</p>
						<p>The firmware installed on the arduino allows it to be directed by G-code instructions. (Similar to a 3D printer, laser cutter, or most other CNC machines)  Through this we have created custom artwork in several different styles, colors, and mediums.  The more complex styles utilize custom software that automatically generates G-code, using a given image as input.</p>

 						<h2>Gripper Project</h2>
 						<img src='IMG_7109.jpg', alt='Pic of Gripper Project'>
 						<h3 class="caption">Final Prototype of Object Gripper, Design I - Fall 2018</h3>
 						<p>Designed and fabricated a lightweight mechanism from scratch, utilizing RAPID prototyping methods to meet strict requirements and fast-approaching deadlines.</p>
 						<p>Mechanism had to grip a heavy weight (Solid metal 'Water bottle') and hold while swinging from a ~2 foot pendulum arm.</p>

						<p>Prototyping allowed the use of physical testing to validate or adjust problem-solving strategies in order to optimize the design and achieve the goal.</p>

						<h2>Astronaut Coat Hanger</h2>

						<h3 class="caption">Astronaut Coat Hanger, an ambitious prototype made after a more conservative design passed testing, Design I - Fall 2018</h3>
						<p>The problem description was to design a 2D geometry to act as a lightweight bracket used to hold a ~10lb load for a duration of 10 seconds.</p>
						<p>Design challenge constraints mandated a restricted area where the bracket geometry could not lie relative to the mounting position. (i.e. a simple, short, v-shaped bracket would have been an illegal submission)</p>
						<img class='gallery' src='IMG_6149.jpg', alt='Hand analysis to drive part design page 1'>

						<img class='gallery' src='IMG_6153.jpg', alt='Hand analysis to drive part design page 3'>
						<img class='gallery' src='IMG_6155.jpg', alt='Hand analysis to drive part design page 4'>
						<p>One of the project's purposes was to use hand analysis techniques in order to develop design intuition for this specific problem, weighing the pros and cons of several design tactics before starting the prototyping process.</p>
						<p>An <b>important lesson</b> was learned about the importance of repeated prototype testing.  The manufacturing method was not consistent enough to produce a bracket that was free enough of defects to be able to hold the weight consistently every time, regardless of what analytical FEA methods displayed and having a theoretical factor of safety of ~1.3.  It certainly was surprising to discover that numerical analysis methods of a simple, static system (even taking things into account such as contact stress) do not circumvent the need to test prototypes or collect empirical data.</p>
						<p>The bracket could have been made several times thicker in failure area, relatively speaking, and would have still have been the lightest in the class by several grams.</p>

 						<h2>Portfolio Website</h2>
						<p>A prominent example of Max's interest in programming, this website, was coded from scratch using his brief html introduction at NASA and his love of picking up technical, project-based hobbies.</p>
						<p>Through this he has become more proficient at CSS, html, JavaScript, and responsive web design.</p>

 						<h2>Knit Totoro Scarf</h2>

 						</div>
 						<h3 class="caption">Each side of the double-knit Totoro Scarf is a negative of its counterpart</h3>
 						<p>On his way to achieving Scouting's highest rank, Max developed a love for knots.  He went above and beyond in terms of learning a variety of different functional and often ornamental knots--much more than what was required to advance ranks.</p>
 						<p>Deciding that he needed a new hobby in college while reminiscing about his days in Boy Scouts, he decided to pick up knitting, due to its similarity to knot tying.</p>
 						<p>This culminated in his first major project: The Totoro Scarf. (After teaching himself how to knit and purl, both in the continental style, using online resources.</p>
 						<p>The impetus behind making a double-knitted scarf was to ensure it was thick enough for Pittsburgh winters, while allowing the creation of a complex design that doesn't involve the backside looking like spaghetti with yarns hanging out everywhere.  Additionally, Max made the design himself, modifying a few instances of pixel art online, but creating the overwhelming majority of the pixellated designs from scratch.</p>
 						<p>Through many hours of intensive labor, and over 40,000 stitches, he was able to complete this project--an intersection of art, functional outerwear, and brain-sharpening hobby.</p>
 						<p><b>Note:</b> The upside down text at the top of each picture is Japanese hiragana, spelling out his name. (This part was added while Max was taking Japanese I as an elective, in case you have observed that foreign names are supposed to be written in katakana, hence the mistake)  The text reads left-to-right on both sides of the scarf which was achieved with a more complex knitting pattern that allows two distinct designs on each side of the scarf, instead of the usual negative/mirror image.</p>

 						<h3 class="caption">Drilling template (left) and the finished board (right)</h3>
 						<p>Upon becoming a fanatic of the card game <i>Cribbage</i>, Max decided to build his own board from scratch.</p>
 						<p>After purchasing a small maple plank at the local lumber store, he used SolidWorks to design a drilling template that fit in to the constrained geometry of the plank.</p>
 						<p>Several hours of drilling and sanding later, he had his own cribbage board that is simple in style and easy to use.</p>
