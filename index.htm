						<h2>ArtBot</h2>
						<img src='IMG_8131.JPG', alt='Pic of Artbot'>
						<h3 class='caption'>ArtBot, Design II Senior Capstone Project - Spring 2021</h3>
						<p>ArtBot is a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) Robot that is able to draw/paint customized artwork from photographs using custom software.</p>
						<p>It utilizes stepper motors and a CNC motor controller plugged into an Arduino Uno.  The system is driven by toothed belts for the X and Y axes of motion, with a dual rack and pinion driving the z-axis implement control.</p>
						<p>The firmware installed on the arduino allows it to be directed by G-code instructions. (Similar to a 3D printer, laser cutter, or most other CNC machines)  Through this we have created custom artwork in several different styles, colors, and mediums.  The more complex styles utilize custom software that automatically generates G-code, using a given image as input.</p>

 						<h2>Gripper Project</h2>
 						<img src='IMG_7109.jpg', alt='Pic of Gripper Project'>
 						<h3 class="caption">Final Prototype of Object Gripper, Design I - Fall 2018</h3>
 						<p>Designed and fabricated a lightweight mechanism from scratch, utilizing RAPID prototyping methods to meet strict requirements and fast-approaching deadlines.</p>
 						<p>Mechanism had to grip a heavy weight (Solid metal 'Water bottle') and hold while swinging from a ~2 foot pendulum arm.</p>

						<p>Prototyping allowed the use of physical testing to validate or adjust problem-solving strategies in order to optimize the design and achieve the goal.</p>

						<h2>Astronaut Coat Hanger</h2>

						<h3 class="caption">Astronaut Coat Hanger, an ambitious prototype made after a more conservative design passed testing, Design I - Fall 2018</h3>
						<p>The problem description was to design a 2D geometry to act as a lightweight bracket used to hold a ~10lb load for a duration of 10 seconds.</p>
						<p>Design challenge constraints mandated a restricted area where the bracked geometry could not lie relative to the mounting position. (i.e. a simple, short, v-shaped bracket would have been an illegal submission)</p>

						<img class='gallery' src='IMG_6150.jpg', alt='Hand analysis to drive part design page 2'>
						<img class='gallery' src='IMG_6153.jpg', alt='Hand analysis to drive part design page 3'>
						<img class='gallery' src='IMG_6155.jpg', alt='Hand analysis to drive part design page 4'>
						<p>One of the project's purposes was to use hand analysis techniques in order to develop design intuition for this specific problem, weighing the pros and cons of several design tactics before starting the prototyping process.</p>
						<p>An <b>important lesson</b> was learned about the importance of repeated prototype testing.  The manufacturing method was not consistent enough to produce a bracket that was free enough of defects to be able to hold the weight consistently every time, regardless of what analytical FEA methods displayed and having a theoretical factor of safety of ~1.3.  It certainly was surprising to discover that numerical analysis methods of a simple, static system (even taking things into account such as contact stress) do not circumvent the need to test prototypes or collect empirical data.</p>
						<p>The bracket could have been made several times thicker in failure area, relatively speaking, and would have still have been the lightest in the class by several grams.</p>

 						<h2>Portfolio Website</h2>
						<p>A prominent example of Max's interest in programming, this website, was coded from scratch using his brief html introductiong at NASA and his love of picking up technical, project-based hobbies.</p>
						<p>Through this he has become more proficient at CSS, html, JavaScript, and responsive web design.</p>
